In this article, I develop a macroeconomic 'fair-value' indicator. This indicator conveniently absorbs statistically significant information that impacts the silver spot price.

**Conclusion** (excerpt, p. 11):

"_(...) empirical analysis suggests that the silver spot price is roughly twice as sensitive to changes in USD expected inflation than it is to changes in the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate. When it comes to market-timing, it can be concluded the following:_

_A Strong Bullish XAG/USD Case:_
* _A silver indicator value I ≥ 10,_
* _A rise in inflation beyond the expected change in future inflation,_
* _A future decrease in the long-term risk-free rate,_
* _An increase in demand for silver as a resource for production,_
* _A decrease in trust in cryptocurrency._

_A Strong Bearish XAG/USD Case:_
* _A silver indicator value I ≤ -10,_
* _A decrease in inflation beyond the expected change in future inflation,_
* _A future increase in the long-term risk-free rate,_
* _A decrease in demand for silver as a resource for production,_
* _A continued increase in trust and acceptance in cryptocurrency._"

**Conclusion** (excerpt, pp. 19-20):

"_When it comes to predicting financial volatility,_

1. _During 'normal' times, the support vector machine algorithm with linear kernel outperforms all other considered methods. This is confirmed by two out-of-sample datasets: The `test` set and the `validation` set's pre-crisis period_
2. _During periods of market turmoil, the gradient boosted tree algorithm outperforms all other considered methods. This is confirmed by the complete `validation` set which is heavily impacted by turbulence surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic_

_The self-developed linear weekday effect model improves over the HAR-RV model by Corsi (2009). It performs second best during 'normal' and 'crisis' times, respectively. The absence of any tuning parameters and the apparent robustness across market conditions makes this model a well-suited candidate for applications in practice._

_Noteworthy, in the appendix, it is found that the industry-prevalent GARCH(1,1) model is outperformed by all models considered._"
