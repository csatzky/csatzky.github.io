**Conclusion** (pp. 19-20):

"_When it comes to predicting financial volatility,_

1. _During 'normal' times, the support vector machine algorithm with linear kernel performs best. This is confirmed by two out-of-sample datasets: The `test` set and the `validation` set's pre-crisis period_
2. _During periods of market turmoil, the gradient boosted tree algorithm performs best. This is confirmed by the complete `validation` set which is heavily impacted by turbulence surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic_

_The self-developed linear weekday effect model improves over the HAR-RV model by Corsi (2009). It performs second best during 'normal' and 'crisis' times, respectively. The absence of any tuning parameters and the apparent robustness across market conditions makes this model a well-suited candidate for applications in practice._

_Noteworthy, in the appendix, it is found that the industry-prevalent GARCH(1,1) model is outperformed by all models considered._"
